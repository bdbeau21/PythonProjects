# NBA STATS Projects
#### The project works with an NBA API to gather stats. The use of these stats is still being determined.

## [PlayerDictionary](https://github.com/bdbeau21/PythonProjects/tree/main/NBASTATS/PlayerDicitonary)
#### Code helps to understand the player dictionary of all players in or have played in the NBA.

## GAMELOG
#### Works with pulling a certain players gamelogs for a certain season or their whole career.
